    Estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) using Monte Carlo simulation from the current state.
    This function runs multiple simulations to predict the number of steps until reaching the 'bad' state.
    
    Parameters:
        hmms (list): List of trained HMMs.
        current_state (str): The current health state of the tool ('good', 'mediocre', or 'bad').
        health_state_mapping (dict): Mapping of HMM indices to health states.
        num_simulations (int): Number of Monte Carlo simulations to run.
        
    Returns:
        float: Estimated RUL in terms of the expected number of sequences (holes) remaining.
